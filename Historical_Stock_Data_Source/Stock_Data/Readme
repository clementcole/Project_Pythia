This Part of the project contains all the data mined from the internet using all.py script which is dependent on the yahoo_finance api the main.
In order to collect data just run the command python all.py after installing python_finance using the command "pip python_finance". Just make sure
you have the latest pip installed on your system.

The actual data in reference to this directory is in the respective labeled stocks. So if you need the data input for AMD its in the AMD folder.
That of APPLE in the APPLE folder and so on.

In order to collect the data using the yahoo_finance api, I wasn't able to load data for all of 5 years all at once so I had to break them up into
chunks. If you navigate into the data folders, they are split into 3 files. 
So each folder contains 3 files where 
	stock_part1 contains stocks from "2011-01-01" to "2012-12-31"
	stock_part2 contains stocks from "2013-01-01" to "2014-12-31"
	stock_part3 contains stocks from "2015-01-01" to "2016-06-30"
So technically speaking, the data is of 5.5 years.
